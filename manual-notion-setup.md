3. Click "Invite"
4. Copy the database URL to get the database ID

## üìù Update Configuration

Once you've created the databases and shared them, copy each database ID from the URL:
```
https://www.notion.so/your-workspace/DATABASE_NAME-{DATABASE_ID}?v=...
```

Then update `08-automation/configs/notion-integration.yaml`:
```yaml
notion:
  databases:
    daily_standups: "your-daily-standup-database-id"
    ai_outputs: "your-ai-outputs-database-id"
    weekly_reviews: "your-weekly-reviews-database-id"
    project_tasks: "your-project-tasks-database-id"
```

## üß™ Test the Setup

After updating the configuration, test it:
```bash
node 08-automation/scripts/notion-sync.js daily "Testing manual setup"
```

2. Name your database
3. Add properties by clicking the "+" next to existing columns
4. Set the property types as specified above
5. Don't forget to share each database with "SkillNavigator AI"
